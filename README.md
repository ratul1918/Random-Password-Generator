# Random Password Generator

A simple, lightweight **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** application that generates secure random passwords of adjustable length, including options for including/excluding uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

This project was inspired by an existing GitHub implementation; I've built on the idea, added my own styling, logic, and improvements.
